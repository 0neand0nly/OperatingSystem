Class Policy
=====
### Communication ###
#### English ####
English is the official language of the ITP 30002 classes. 
All contents delivered in these classes will be in English. 
Students are obligated to produce all results in English, including homework, assignment report, answers of midterm/final exam. 
Note that non-English descriptions will be excluded in all kinds of evaluations.

In class meetings, it is highly recommended for all class members to use English for discussion. 
Yet, to promote active class participation, students are allowed to use Korean in asking and answering questions, which will be repeated in English by the instructor.
In addition, the instructor can use Korean to rephrase what he had already said in English; in this case as well, the instructor repeat in English what he said in Korean for double-check.

#### Contact with Instructor ####
**Questions**: Use Slack. Write a message to the class channel. 
This is to make questions and answers public that all class members can share them easily. 
For this reason, the instructor and the TAs will not response to any personal contacts (e.g., via email).

**Administrative requests**
For claiming attendance update or other adminsitrative requests, you must write a message at the ``#admin-request`` channel. 
This makes the claiming process accountable and transparent to all class members.

For a case where privacy matters, you first write a message at ``#admin-request`` and then send the instructor a message via Slack to tranfer privacy-sensitive information (e.g., a proof for an approved absence).

**Counseling session**: Students can request a counselling session to the
instructor to ask academic advice. 
To make an appointment with the instructor, submit an answer to the following
pre-interview form: https://forms.gle/KbREJ1b5S13nD51V7. 
When a new submission is received, the instructor will send a reply to arrange 
a personal counseling session. Note that the instructor does not arrange any 
personal meeting at an exam season.


**Improper solicitation**:
All kinds of improper soliciatations are strictly forbidden as declared in the Improper Solicitation 
and Graft Act (aka. Kim Young-ran Act), including the following cases:
:
1. Students cannot give a gift in any form to the instructor or the TA (even a can of coffee)
   while they are officially students in Handong
1. Students can claim for correcting any error in evaluation, however they cannot ask the instructor/TA to change their gradings or any kind of evaluations
1. Students cannot ask the instructor/TA any kind of unfair evaluations, even for exceptional cases. They must go to the Academic Affair Team to discuss their circumstances. Only upon the approvement from the Academic Affair Team, the instructor can change the rule/policy for the specific students.

Any violation of these will be reported to the Acaemic Affair Team for treatments. c.f.

#### Teaching assistant (TA) ####
TAs are working primary for assisting the instructor in conducting class meetings, in supporting students for accomplishing assignments, and in
processing educational materials such as grading exam/quizzes/assignments. 
There may be help desk sessions offered by TAs if required.
Note that students cannot ask questions beyond the class material or ask personal help outside of the help hour.
